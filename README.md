# NotesWebApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.10.

## About the project

For my senior year in high school, we were required to get an internship and write a research paper for english class. I decided to find a mentor that would teach me more about the computer science field because I look to study the field deeper in university. My mentor teaches me how to make a web application using the Angular framework and TypeScript. 

The project we decided to work on is a web application to take notes. Here you can see all the code for that application and the history of the code.
